Type into the Safari address bar immediatly after creating a new tab

TypeTab is a tweak that improves Safari by allowing you to type text into the address bar in less taps. When you create a new tab, instead of having to tap on the address bar to type into it, you are instantly able to type into it. You can also type into the address bar immediatly after opening Safari. This small change will make a big difference for people who frequently create new tabs. This tweak supports both the iPhone and iPad versions of Safari. The Safari new tab keyboard shortcut is also supported. This tweak has been tested on iOS 8.1, and should work for all version of iOS 7 and 8. If you run into any issues, please contact me!
